Team:

Okay, let's start. Is the product complete?

Customer:

According to what we agreed, yes, it has puzzles, multiplayer, menu somehow, and single player, boss, melee attack, short range attack, and some… In the short term, I will consider Spear. No, it's medium term. Middle. Yeah, middle term. Middle is Spear, sword for short range and long range rifle.

And boss fights, I think everything complete. And it has music and good graphics, so yeah.

Team:

Thank you. Is you using the product?

Customer:

Not right now, but the question is in the future, yes. For me, some components of the product is more important than the game itself for now, but probably in the future, yes, the game itself as well.

Team:

Has you deployed the product on your site?

Customer:

Actually, yes. All we need is to fork the repo and then have the instance built on each other, so yes.

Team:

Okay, what measures need to be taken to fully transcribe the product?

Customer:

So, the measurements are to have a good readme and documentation, I think you have already readme and documentation? Yes. Okay, and then merge all the branches to main, so every code is in the main and I can fork the repo as well. It's considered as transferred product.

Team:

Okay, which plans do you have for the product after its delivery?

Customer:

Probably somehow maintaining it and using some part of it. But not a concrete plan for now. Probably, if it's possible, we can continue it in Capstone project next year as well. Because we have something like this project next year. Capstone is also a problem to make it fully complete.

Team:

How to increase the chance that it will be useful after the final delivery?

Customer:

The readme should be completed and also you have a good quality attribute for maintaining it. We have done this iteration of showing the code before merging, so it has been already taken into account.

Team:

OK, can you provide right now feedback about our readme?

Customer:

OK, can I see it once more? Yeah, OK.

OK. It is a good… You can add which editors you are using, because it was not matching with my editor version before. And you can add one section as how did you achieve your quality attributes.

You write some quality attributes scenarios and how did you achieve it can be an extra section for this.

Team:

Okay, thank you. I think that's it.
